### Made during ETHBucharest 2024 hackathon
Gnomish let's you easily bootstrap your public goods project via memes 🧙‍♀️

Gnomish is a degenerate public goods non-quadratic funding on Base a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. Our project is utilizing the ever-present power of memes for the benefit of the ecosystem, enabling:

- Meaningful allocation of often meaningless tokens.
- Distribution via provably verifiable, private random functions.
- Endless memes, and...
- Risk of rug! (<1%)

By leveraging the degen culture, Gnomish strives to create a new narrative arc – Dump your Memecoins to Pump the public goods… **Expect the Unexpected!**

## How does it work?

When a user visits the platform, they are presented with a set of projects that has been selected to participate in the current funding round. Immediately after, the user is offered to select a memecoin of their choice and proceed to transfer the funds to the specific *RoundPool*.

Every round is finalized after a *2-week open funding cycle*, leading to an **Event of Randomness** – the crown jewel of the platform.

When memes hit the fan users will be able to observe a dashboard update that will uncover the following:

- **Which #project will receive 100% of which #token**. a) Some projects might receive multiple tokens supplied. b) Some projects may not receive any.
- **What will be the distribution strategy?** a) Some projects might receive all the funds immediately. b) Some projects may receive the funds with a random cliff, and or random vesting.

## Why?... You ask!?

... Why not, we answer!? Once a degen, always a degen. Thanks to Gnomish we can now feel the thrill of randomness and potential rug pull all while funding public goods on Ethereum!

## Sponsors Tech Used

### Buidl Guidl

We utilized Scaffold-ETH2 to establish the framework, and structure of the project.

### Base

As a layer 2 solution we deployed our smart contracts on Base Network, and utilized its endless memetic potential.

### Secret Network

We "abused" the VRF contract on Secret Network for confidential randomness computing. We pick random winners, random streams of funds distribution, as well as random chance of the RoundPool balance rug.

### Sablier

We used 3 different streams (exponential, linear, and dynamic segmentation) for funds distribution to individual public goods projects.
